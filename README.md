# SQL-INJECTION
**SQL Injection** is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It typically occurs when user input is improperly sanitized or validated, enabling malicious SQL statements to be executed.

### Important Considerations Before Exploring SQL Injection Types

Before diving into the different types of *SQL Injection*, it's essential to first identify the type of database you're dealing with. For example, when working with an **Oracle** database, understanding its specific syntax and quirks is crucial, such as how to write queries and use comments correctly.

## üö® Types of SQL Injection    

### In-Band SQL Injection  
- It occurs when the attacker uses the same communication channel to inject malicious SQL code.
   

#### Error-Based Injection  
- Exploits database error messages to extract data.  

#### Union-Based Injection  
- Uses the `UNION` operator to combine and retrieve data from multiple tables.
   ### How to Prove the Concept of a Vulnerable Application Database with *Union-Based* Injection

  To prove that an application database is vulnerable to *Union-Based* SQL Injection, follow these steps:

   1. **Identify the number of columns in the database** by injecting the following SQL code:
    ```sql
    ' UNION SELECT NULL -- 
    ```

   2. If the above query doesn't work, try adding more columns to match the number expected by the query:
       ```sql
       ' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL -- 
       ```

   Keep adding columns (e.g., `NULL, NULL, NULL --`) until you identify the correct number of columns that the query expects.

  for real example from PortS here in the example i tried to inject the SQL code
   - first inject
      ```sql
       ' UNION SELECT NULL-- 
       ```
      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/234954be-999d-4bda-b9c8-cf689968c6e1)

      After that i recive the Internal server error

 - Second Injection
     ```sql
       ' UNION SELECT NULL#
       ```

  - Third Injection:
    ```sql
       ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL-- 
       ```
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7dd060c8-59f5-4205-8ec9-874cd8f47936)

     After that i recive 200 ok and the page interact with the injected SQL code. That means it is vulnirble

### Blind SQL Injection  

#### Boolean-Based Blind Injection  
- Sends queries that return true/false and observes application behavior.  

#### Time-Based Blind Injection  
- Uses queries that trigger time delays to infer responses.  

### Out-of-Band SQL Injection  
- Relies on a separate communication channel (e.g., DNS or HTTP) for data retrieval, often used when in-band methods are unavailable.  

### Second-Order SQL Injection  
- Malicious input is stored in the database and executed later when retrieved by the application.  

### Stored Persistent SQL Injection  
- Payload is saved in the database (e.g., via forms) and executed when data is displayed, affecting all users.

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies  

- Use **parameterized queries** or **prepared statements**.  
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs.  
- Avoid displaying detailed database error messages in production.  
- Employ the **principle of least privilege** for database users.  
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
