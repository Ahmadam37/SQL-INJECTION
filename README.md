üéØ This repository provides examples and best practices for understanding and preventing SQL Injection.  

# SQL-INJECTION
**SQL Injection** is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It typically occurs when user input is improperly sanitized or validated, enabling malicious SQL statements to be executed.

## üö® Types of SQL Injection    

### In-Band SQL Injection  
- It occurs when the attacker uses the same communication channel to inject malicious SQL code.
   

#### Error-Based Injection  
- Exploits database error messages to extract data.  

#### Union-Based Injection  
- Uses the `UNION` operator to combine and retrieve data from multiple tables.
   ### How to Prove the Concept of a Vulnerable Application Database with *Union-Based* Injection

  To prove that an application database is vulnerable to *Union-Based* SQL Injection, follow these steps:

   1. **Identify the number of columns in the database** by injecting the following SQL code:
    ```sql
    ' UNION SELECT NULL -- 
    ```

   2. If the above query doesn't work, try adding more columns to match the number expected by the query:
       ```sql
       ' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL -- 
       ```

   Keep adding columns (e.g., `NULL, NULL, NULL --`) until you identify the correct number of columns that the query expects.


### Blind SQL Injection  

#### Boolean-Based Blind Injection  
- Sends queries that return true/false and observes application behavior.  

#### Time-Based Blind Injection  
- Uses queries that trigger time delays to infer responses.  

### Out-of-Band SQL Injection  
- Relies on a separate communication channel (e.g., DNS or HTTP) for data retrieval, often used when in-band methods are unavailable.  

### Second-Order SQL Injection  
- Malicious input is stored in the database and executed later when retrieved by the application.  

### Stored Persistent SQL Injection  
- Payload is saved in the database (e.g., via forms) and executed when data is displayed, affecting all users.

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies  

- Use **parameterized queries** or **prepared statements**.  
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs.  
- Avoid displaying detailed database error messages in production.  
- Employ the **principle of least privilege** for database users.  
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
