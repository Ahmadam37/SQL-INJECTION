üéØ This repository provides examples and best practices for understanding and preventing SQL Injection.  

# SQL-INJECTION
**SQL Injection** is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It typically occurs when user input is improperly sanitized or validated, enabling malicious SQL statements to be executed.


# üõ°Ô∏è SQL Injection: Types and Mitigation  

**SQL Injection** is a critical web security vulnerability that allows attackers to interfere with database queries. This document outlines the types of SQL Injection attacks and how to prevent them.  

## üö® Types of SQL Injection  

1. **In-Band SQL Injection**: It occurs when the attacker uses the same communication channel to inject malicious SQL code. 
   - **Error-Based Injection:** Exploits database error messages to extract data.  
   - **Union-Based Injection:** Uses the `UNION` operator to combine and retrieve data from multiple tables.  

3. **Blind SQL Injection**  
   - **Boolean-Based Blind Injection:** Sends queries that return true/false and observes application behavior.  
   - **Time-Based Blind Injection:** Uses queries that trigger time delays to infer responses.  

4. **Out-of-Band SQL Injection**  
   Relies on a separate communication channel (e.g., DNS or HTTP) for data retrieval, often used when in-band methods are unavailable.  

5. **Second-Order SQL Injection**  
   Malicious input is stored in the database and executed later when retrieved by the application.  

6. **Stored (Persistent) SQL Injection**  
   Payload is saved in the database (e.g., via forms) and executed when data is displayed, affecting all users.  

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies  

- Use **parameterized queries** or **prepared statements**.  
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs.  
- Avoid displaying detailed database error messages in production.  
- Employ the **principle of least privilege** for database users.  
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
